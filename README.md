## About the Video Course
This course shows you step-by-step how to use Azure Building Blocks to deploy your Node.js microservice-based apps to the cloud.
You will start with what cloud-native applications are and their benefits. You will also learn about the crucial reasons for developing a Node.js app and deploying it on Azure. Then you will understand different Azure services, highlight Azure building blocks used by Node.js apps, and deploy your Node.js applications on the Azure Cloud platform. Finally, you will monitor and troubleshoot your Node.js applications with Azure App Insights.
By the end of the course, you will have mastered building an application in Node.js that's based on microservices, deploying it on the Azure Cloud platform, and monitoring and troubleshooting it with Azure App Insights.
